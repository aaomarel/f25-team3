## About Me
Hi! My name is Ahmed Omar, I'm in my senior year of computer science. A few hobbies of mine are: Playing soccer, reading, playing chess, and riding motorcycles (GSXR 600R). My career goal is either to become a software engineer or become involved with AI development in some way. 

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope to learn how to program in a more "professional" way. Understanding team dynamics when it comes to programming is an essential part of software engineering, and I look forward to becoming more familiar with industry standards.
