## Description 
> The product will offer a service to people wanting to find pick up games for either soccer or basketball. We were motivated by our shared passion of recreational sports and the understanding of how hard it can be to get people together to play, especially if you don't know many people. This app aims to remove that obstacle.

## App Functions
1. Customer (the user with the customer role):
    1. Create/modify customer profile - <how will your app do this?>
    2. View available services - <how will your app do this?>.
    3. Subscribe to available services - <how will your app do this?>.
    4. Write reviews for subscribed services - <how will your app do this?>.
2. Provider:
    1. Create a user profile - All users must create a profile, and all profiles have the ability to either join or create a game instance.
    2. Create game instances - The provider will have the ability to create game instances if no games that have already been created.
    3. Designate play locations and time periods - The provider will be responsible for choosing locations to play and what times. The option to create a game instance will appear for anyone if they find an open slot, and the time/location slots will be pre-determined.
